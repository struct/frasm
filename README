frasm is a Ruby binding for Distorm3 v3.3 written by Gil Dabah [http://ragestorm.net/distorm/]

The frasm binding was originally written by Tom Ptacek and has since been updated by Chris Rohlf

frasm requires you have built and installed libdistorm

Distorm comes with pystorm by default so when you create distorm3.{so,bundle,dll} be sure to compile like so:
'make clib' otherwise ruby will throw an error due to undefined python symbols
make sure you have the libdistorm3.so (linux) / distorm3.dylib (mac) under your search path

---------------
Compiling Frasm
---------------
cd src/

ruby extconf.rb

make
make install (may require sudo)

The directories linux/ osx/ and win32 also have manually created Makefiles if extconf.rb fails you, will need tweaking to work with your local paths and rubies

-------------------
Example frasm usage
-------------------

require 'frasm'

d = Frasm::DistormDecoder.new

d.decode("\x90\x90\x90\x33\xc0\x66\xb8\x34\x12\x50\x40\xc3").each do |l|
    puts "#{l.mnem} #{l.size} #{l.offset} #{l.raw}"
end
